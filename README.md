Intro
=====
The go-ecies implements the Elliptic Curve Integrated Encryption Scheme.

This is a fork from the umbracle/ecies,
who did great job to extract the ECIES encryption from the go-ethereum package.

The package is designed to be compliant with the appropriate NIST
standards, and therefore doesn't support the full SEC 1 algorithm set.

Status
======
The ECIES should is ready for use. It is already used as is in the Foundries.io
projects (e.g. foundriesio/fioconfig) for the encryption of device configuration files.

The ASN.1 support is only complete so far, as to support the listed algorithms before.

Supported Ciphers
=================
A list of supported curves was selected based on NIST SP 800-186 Draft.  Thus, for example, the
Koblitz curves (`secpXXXk1` in SEC 2) are not supported by Golang and not recommended by NIST.

Note: If one wants to use the Koblitz curves with this package, their minimal implementation can be
found in e.g. https://github.com/decred/dcrd/blob/master/dcrec/secp256k1/ellipticadaptor.go.

The default symmetric cipher and hash parameters are the following:

    +-------+-------------+---------+--------------+
    | Curve |    Cipher   |  Hash   |   Auth Tag   |
    +-------+-------------+---------+--------------+
    | P-256 | AES-128-CTR | SHA-256 | HMAC-SHA-256 |
    +-------+-------------+---------+--------------+
    | P-384 | AES-192-CTR | SHA-384 | HMAC-SHA-384 |
    +-------+-------------+---------+--------------+
    | P-521 | AES-256-CTR | SHA-512 | HMAC-SHA-512 |
    +-------+-------------+---------+--------------+

The P-224 curve is not supported. As per SEC 1 section 3.11 guidance it is too weak to protect
sensitive data beyond 2030. The P-256 is currently the default curve supported by the Foundries.io
LmP platform. So, we recommend to use P-256 default parameters from the above table unless you have
a specific requirement for a stronger encryption strength.

The key derivation function used: NIST SP 800-56c Concatenation KDF.

The CMAC based message tag and the CBC cipher schema are currently not supported.
